Library users are able to access an amazing set of non-book/text tools, but the library is still figuring out the infrastructure for lending these resources. Tools are not checked out for predictable time-spans, are in high demand, potentially need more instruction than text, potentially have multiple pieces, etc. We propose that a chatbot could mediate the non-book loan process, which is much more personalized and nebulous than the book loan process.
